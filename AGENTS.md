# Agent Instructions

- Always read `.agents/docs/Context.md` before making decisions or edits.
- Consult relevant skills from `.agents/skills` when the task matches their scope.
- For UI sizing changes, always verify size tokens/variants in `src/components/ui/*` first and prefer component variants over manual Tailwind height/padding overrides.
